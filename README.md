## Introduction
This project is a arcade game. The starter project had some HTML, CSS and JS files for the project. I contributed mainly to the app.js file to make the game playable. This required modifying the enemy and adding player classed in the app.js file. 

## About
Added functionality to the enemies and player in the canvas. The bugs(enemies) spawn from the left side of the canvas and traverse to right with random speeds. The player spawns at a fixed location. The player can move with arrow keys. Main goal is to reach the upper end of the canvas to win the game. If player collides with enemy the position of player is reset and if he wins the game , player spawns at his/her initial position. Different Avatars of player is generated if the page is refreshed.

This project was a part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Program.
